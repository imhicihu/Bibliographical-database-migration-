### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
     - Microsoft Windows XP (original operating system)
     - WinIsis (database original cataloger)
	 - VirtualBox (software to virtualize operating system inside other operating systems)
	 - [Beautiful Soap](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download): unencoding of unicode text to UTF-8 format specification. A kind of swiss-army knife of encoding-unencoding text files. 
	 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): deploy apps inside virtual environments. A time-saver in the process of cut and paste in-from a myriad of applications between different operating systems.
